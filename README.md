# Arthas
Arthas is a Java diagnostic tool open-sourced by the Alibaba middleware team. It enables us to monitor, profile, hot reload and troubleshoot our Java applications. One of the key benefits of using Arthas is that we don't need to change our code or even restart the Java services that we want to monitor.
